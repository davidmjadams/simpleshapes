<p>I’m going to attempt to write weekly.</p>

<p>Certainly, if not weekly, then fortnightly. I have 2 young daughters, I need to bake in some slack somewhere.</p>

<p>I’ve long been meaning to start writing properly. I’ve dipped in and out a little recently, but I’m hoping by drawing a starting line, I can make it a regular, deliberate practise. Who knows if it will stick.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>First of all, this is for me. It’s a high probability that no-ones going to read this, and I think that’s ok. This is primarily an exercise in improving my communication, and more importantly, my confidence in putting stuff out there. Particularly stuff that I consider not to be perfect, but good enough.</p>

<p>I enjoy it, it’s cathartic. As someone who doesn&rsquo;t give a huge amount of themselves away, to write thoughts and feelings down has a huge therapeutic quality. Well. I enjoy the writing, not so much the publishing. What if someone, or everyone reads it and thinks it’s not very good? That’s the point, nobody cares. This is a lesson is realising that.</p>

<p>I want to be much more comfortable putting ideas out there that I’m not 100% on, that might not hold up to scrutiny. I used to take pride in my perfectionism, it meant having a higher standard, that others wouldn’t or couldn’t achieve. I realise now it is a weakness. Something that I actively encourage others, particularly in the software product development world, to leave behind. It’s a road to nowhere. Or at least it’s the long winding road to something that might be 10% better, but take 500% longer to produce. Or maybe it wouldn’t even be better. I want to take my own advice.</p>

<p>There’s the standard cycle, which hopefully is familiar to some. You work on something, you’re pretty pleased with the result. Come back to it a few days later, and now you think it is weak at best. It’s a case of warped perspective. Once the risk of critique comes, the assumptions that it must be no good start bedding in.</p>

<p>This is nonsense. This is why I’m doing this. To learn that even if you put something that’s not the best thing you’ve ever done out there. It really, <em>really</em> doesn’t matter.</p>

<p>I mean, hopefully, there will be some good stuff in there too.</p>

<p>Anyway, who knows how long this will last. But this is the starting line. I hope it will be fun.</p>
