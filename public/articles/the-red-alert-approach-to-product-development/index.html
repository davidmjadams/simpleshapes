<h2 id="launching-new-products-is-really-hard">Launching new products is really hard.</h2>

<p>Each year around 30,000 new products are introduced, of these, <a href="https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/clay-christensens-milkshake-marketing">95% fail</a>. Think about that for a second. You and your 19 closest friends all decide to launch your own products. Before long, only Bert is left standing, with a product that people actually want to buy. Stupid Bert.</p>

<p>I‚Äôll say it again, launching new products is really, <em>really</em> hard. There are so many things you need to be doing, every day a new article tells you about a new thing that‚Äôs you aren‚Äôt doing that you absolutely must be doing to be successful. Not to mention the absolutely massive chunk of luck you need, even when you have best practices coming out of the wazoo.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt have the answers. I don‚Äôt think anyone fully does. Every time I find myself in a situation where it seems like there is an unending list of things that need to be done or we don‚Äôt know how to approach, I always end up thinking about playing Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert as a child. This dates me significantly. For the uninitiated, it‚Äôs a game that was popular in the mid-90s.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs essentially a classic empire-building strategy game. You start with a small patch of land surrounding by a blacked-out map where your enemies and new terrain to be discovered sit. You need to mine to get money to build your army, build your infrastructure, send your people out to explore increase your territory and reveal the map, but try to do too much of anything at once and you‚Äôll leave your base exposed without sufficient defences to protect itself. So it‚Äôs a fine balance. I was also about 12, so tactics weren‚Äôt exactly something I considered too heavily.</p>

<p>This act of trying to succeed in massive uncertainty, all while keeping multiple threads running together is a lot like building a new product. Specifically the product development efforts. Using the following 4 signals, you can tell a lot about the health of your product team.</p>

<h2 id="clarity-of-mission">Clarity of mission</h2>

<p>Can all team members tell you how what they are working on helps the long-term strategy of the company? If your team knows this, they can make informed decisions about priority and focus, without needing managerial input. It will help you to be brutal about what really needs to be done, and what just seems like it might be quite nice.</p>

<h2 id="ability-to-release-code-frequently">Ability to release code frequently</h2>

<p>Ideally daily or even hourly. Slow-release cycles and difficult release procedures are a warning sign that something isn‚Äôt healthy. Is the state of the software unpredictable, are you not sure how one change might affect another part of the system? If you have the confidence to release whenever you want, you can adapt to change at a moments notice. If you want to ship a new feature quickly, you don‚Äôt want your infrastructure standing in your way. A strong <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">CI</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery">CD</a> setup will help no-end in enforcing this.</p>

<h2 id="customer-input-driven-work">Customer input-driven work</h2>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">‚ÄúWe know our users/customers&quot; <a href="https://t.co/vFyHc8ZvPZ">pic.twitter.com/vFyHc8ZvPZ</a></p>&mdash; Keith Stoeckeler üçî (@keiths) <a href="https://twitter.com/keiths/status/1057345856507207680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 30, 2018</a></blockquote>

Hopefully, this one is obvious. What percentage of work is driven by direct customer feedback? Even if you are a domain expert, you are not the customer. You are too close to the product to view through the eyes of a customer. Customers are great, as Jeff Bezos said ‚ÄúCustomers are always beautifully, wonderfully dissatisfied‚Äù, they have stuff they want to get done and they don‚Äôt care much for your feelings. Listen deeply and try to solve their problems. Don‚Äôt let them tell you what to build though, they know their problems not necessarily what the best solution is. That‚Äôs your job.</p>

<h2 id="iteration">Iteration</h2>

<p>It‚Äôs scary how often product development teams work super hard to ship a feature, then as soon as it‚Äôs released move on to the next one. It‚Äôs an easy trap to fall into, there is so much that needs to be done. But there is no way you‚Äôre going to be spot-on in perfectly satisfying the customer need at first attempt. It‚Äôs better to solve a few problems exceptionally than many problems poorly.</p>

<h2 id="find-a-balance">Find a balance</h2>

<p>If you focus too heavily on one neglecting the others, your ability to adapt and change in the right direction will be limited. It‚Äôs all about balance.</p>

<p>The image of the Command &amp; Conquer terrain, with your camp slowly being built out, defending from incoming attacks helps keep me sane. You can‚Äôt do everything, if you try you‚Äôll spread yourself too thin without a solid base, you won‚Äôt be around long. So keep a balance and just focus on every week being a little bit better than you were the week before. You can‚Äôt control the future, but you can build stable foundations that can adapt to a changing environment. Also, a few of those Tesla coils can only help.</p>
