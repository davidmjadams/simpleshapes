# David Adams

I'm an all-round product person, a child of the web standards movement, currently helping to build future giants at <a href="https://www.kametventures.com/">Kamet Ventures</a>. I love getting deep into the data to solve complex problems.

I try to combine <a href="https://jtbd.info/">Jobs to be done</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development">lean software delivery</a> and <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/5-stages-in-the-design-thinking-process">design thinking</a> to build products that are useful, ethical and beautiful.

I ❤️ making <a href="/logos">logos</a> for fun.
