Every now and again, I try to write regularly, or be active on Twitter. Following the advice, you see everywhere about how to build an audience or whatever.

Quickly, I lose interest and realise I'm not even sure if that's something I want.

This is a note-to-self that this doesn't exist for any other reason than I quite like to do it sometimes.

I prefer a low key profile. I just quite like writing.
