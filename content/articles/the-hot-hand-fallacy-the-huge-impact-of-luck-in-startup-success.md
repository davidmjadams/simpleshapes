**_The point of this article is that it’s all fucking random, so embrace that for your best chances of success_**

  _ explain the hot-hand fallacy [source]
  "We develop a model of the gambler’s fallacy—the mistaken belief that random sequences should
exhibit systematic reversals. We show that an individual who holds this belief and observes a sequence
of signals can exaggerate the magnitude of changes in an underlying state but underestimate their
duration. When the state is constant, and so signals are i.i.d., the individual can predict that long
streaks of similar signals will continue—a hot-hand fallacy. When signals are serially correlated, the
individual typically under-reacts to short streaks, over-reacts to longer ones, and under-reacts to very
long ones. Our model has implications for a number of puzzles in finance, e.g. the active-fund and
fund-flow puzzles, and the presence of momentum and reversal in asset returns." - https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/rabin/files/ghfta_resf.pdf
  
  _ CEO/coaches don’t make that much difference \* stock market is close to random [source] - make money off human error
  "Another test that Weber ran that contradicts the random walk hypothesis, was finding stocks that have had an upward revision for earnings outperform other stocks in the following six months. With this knowledge, investors can have an edge in predicting what stocks to pull out of the market and which stocks — the stocks with the upward revision — to leave in. Martin Weber’s studies detract from the random walk hypothesis, because according to Weber, there are trends and other tips to predicting the stock market." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk_hypothesis
  
  If it was possible to truly plan & predict an outcome, you'd be reading this on google plus…
  
  
- maybe the small midwestern towns evidence bias [source - stats done wrong?]
- survivorship bias
- Availability heuristic: we judge how likely something is by the number of occurrences of it we can bring to memory.
Confirmation bias: once we have a belief, we unconsciously seek out evidence that confirms it and ignore evidence that contradicts it.
Denominator neglect: we look at only the numerator — the number of smokers — and ignore the denominator — the total people we see over the course of a day.

## The point of all this - a few key factors
* Luck
* Connections - YC, generational wealth, repeat founders
* Timing - inflexion point
* Planning
* Execution - feedback loops

It's pretty random, if not totally random. Connections are biggest factor - generational wealth transfer study. You can have a poorly managed team but be successful. without throwing shade, check out some glassdoor rewviews of highly successful companies. 

## Luck & timing
- luck and timing - companies too early/late
	- inflexion point of new tech affordability/scalability
		- cloud, drones, sattelites
  - dot com boom, money coming to valley after financial crisis, broadband, mobiles, cloud computing
  - companies pivoting from what they started out as
  - no business plan survives first contact with the market
  - having the best product (beta max, itunes quality) [google companies with best product that failed]
  - too early/too late
- the drunkards walk?? not sure if relevant

## Research only gets you so far
research is good, but prediciting past behaviour is much more reliable than future \* you want your basics covered, but there is no certainty (70% of the information you think you need ?Bezos?), fallacy of certainty
- everyone said keyboards were essential for their business needs (possibly microsoft research??)

## Hard work, smart work, talent all increase you chances


## how to optimise for randomness -
  _ small feedback loops
  take risks, but listen carefully
  _ bake in ability to change
  - focus on needs not features
- plan for themes not specifics
  _ longer something is not in contact with the market, the more risky it is.
