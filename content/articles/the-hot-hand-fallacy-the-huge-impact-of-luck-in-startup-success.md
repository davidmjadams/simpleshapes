**_The point of this article is that it’s all fucking random, so embrace that for your best chances of success_**

- roulette story
  _ explain the hot-hand fallacy [source]
  _ CEO/coaches don’t make that much difference \* stock market is close to random [source] - make money off human error
- maybe the menstrual cycles [source - stats done wrong?]
- maybe the small midwestern towns evidence bias [source - stats done wrong?]
- survivorship bias
- luck and timing - companies too early/late
  _ dot com boom, money coming to valley after financial crisis, broadband, mobiles, cloud computing
  _ companies pivoting from what they started out as
  _ no business plan survives first contact with the market
  _ having the best product (beta max, itunes quality) [google companies with best product that failed]
- the drunkards walk?? not sure if relevant
- research is good, but prediciting past behaviour is much more reliable than future \* you want your basics covered, but there is no certainty (70% of the information you think you need), fallacy of certainty
- how to optimise for randomness -
  _ small feedback loops
  _ bake in ability to change
  _ focus on needs not features
  _ longer something is not in contact with the market, the more risky it is.
