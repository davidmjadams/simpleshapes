Ten years ago, when Intercom was starting, the concept of a business messenger barely existed. Customer communication was limited at best and generally restricted to emails and call centres. A lot has changed in the past decade. The SaaS market has expanded from $21B to $157B, while Ecommerce has grown $500B to $4T. Everything now happens online — communication needs to happen in an instant, and so we have seen the rise of the business messenger.

The following is an examination of the market as it currently stands and where the route to winning the market might be in the long term. The list of products is not exhaustive but is representative of the industry approaches at large.

## Similar products, different jobs

The field of competitors is broad. On the surface, the messenger products appear very similar; especially the instant chat functions. They provide a familiar interface, akin to personal messengers, to communicate directly with companies.

When you consider the broader companies they represent, the distinctions are more pronounced. A look at the strapline on their homepages is revealing. At the top level, we can split the field in two. Facebook Messenger ("Be together, whenever.") and WhatsApp ("Simple. Secure.
Reliable messaging") sit in one camp — personal messengers that have broadened out to give businesses tools to communicate to users through their platforms. The core problems they are solving are around bringing people together and building personal relationships.

The other big players (Intercom, Drift, HelpScout, ZenDesk) sit on the other side — business first messengers. They focus on solving the needs of businesses in communicating with their customers. Within this group, it is possible to segment further. When you look at how these products position themselves, you get a glimpse in the job they are trying to get done for their customers.

Drift has taken a strong position in focussing on lead generation ("Book More Sales Meetings"). It's a smart move, as there are few companies where this isn't the top priority. It builds a strong base to scale out from.

HelpScout ("Deliver great customer service") and ZenDesk ("Build the best customer experiences") are more classically focused. A digitised version of traditional customer support. This is a safe, logical option; but perhaps at risk from the changing digital landscape.

Finally, Intercom ("Better customer relationships start here"), is aiming to build customer relationships. It's a more significant task but potentially has the biggest rewards.

## Long-term relationships beat short-term sales

When markets mature, differentiation becomes more difficult; brand loyalty is the most potent weapon companies have. When the majority of people think about sportswear, they think of Nike. The holy grail for a brand is to become a shortcut in peoples brains like this. Customer relationships engender brand loyalty, which builds advocates which feeds the flywheel.

Sales are important, customer service solving your problems is important, but a customer doesn't think in these terms. For one, they don't think of themselves as customers. They simply think in terms of getting what they need to solve their problem and moving on with their life. An effective conversion is excellent once but doesn't necessarily feed into future loyalty.

## Who can win? Perfect state, backwards

Before considering how the field might evolve, it's worth considering what problem customers and businesses who use these messenger platforms are trying to solve. By examining the perfect end state and working backwards, we can see how close the competition is to the core.

### Customer

For the majority of customers, the perfect state is not to have any interaction at all. They simply want their problem solved and move on. We are in the real world, however, and things will go wrong. So when this perfect state is unachievable, then this is the point for the messenger to step in. The approach of the messengers here differs in priority.

The business-led messengers vary on their core goals. Sales led (Drift) is focused on a business need rather than a customer need. With this as a north star, the customer won't be prioritised in cases when their needs conflict with the conversion goal. Support led (Helpscout, Zendesk) are well placed to solve today's issue, but the priority is more task-oriented, without a long-term view. Relationship led (Intercom), perhaps is less focussed on the singular interaction so could lag in this instance; but is set up well to focus on the long term. This priority should shine through as an advantage as time progresses. Of the group, Intercom and Drift concentrate more closely on a core need, with differing priorities of focus. Business vs customer.

Personal messengers focus on very different priorities. It's all about communication between two individuals. The perfect state for these is to enable the closeness of an intimate relationship, even while at a distance. The business propositions are an additional layer on top. With the convergence of the industry, everyone is closer than ever before. The interaction model feels a little unnatural currently through these platforms — it's almost too close. Though as the next generation comes of age, having been born with an iPhone in hand, the boundary becomes less significant.

### Business

For businesses, the messenger products they use solve one of two core problems. They both ultimately revolve around making more money. They are businesses, after all.

The basic is to resolve customer problems and thus increase sales conversions and retention. Where barriers exist in the process, a messenger is a great tool to interject and help them through. The second is to create long-term growth through brand loyalty and ultimately, increase revenue per user. Customer relationships are essential, but without the accompanying custom, no business is going to last long.

Finally, and most importantly, they create a means to understand their customers better. Not only to solve the problems they have now but to anticipate what they might need in the future. The closer this relationship, the better chance the business has of long-term success.

## The future

The past decade has seen the rise of social networks into the mainstream. They are now an unavoidable part of everyday life. The customer-brand relationship has never been closer; the boundaries are blurring. People can have human-to-human interactions with brands. It follows that this convergence will only continue. Which opens up an exciting space for the future of customer relationships.

### Meet them where they are

The personal messenger products are well-positioned in the fight to be the go-to channel to interact directly with customers. They already have a moat of scale — it's incredibly challenging to get people to switch platforms. By allowing businesses a channel into these platforms, there is potential to evolve the whole framework of business to consumer interactions. Half the battle is getting the users; clearly, the consumer messengers have a head start. However, consumers are becoming far more privacy-aware. Over the next few years, it seems likely that privacy will continue to grow. The growing suspicion of Facebook leaves an opening.

At present business first messengers are still a conduit. They are generally in-app or on-site. Users have to go directly to the business to buy a product or receive a service. This leaves companies at the behest of Facebook and Google; they own the channels for acquiring customers.

With the growing number of businesses now using business messengers, there is a captive audience. An opportunity exists to take the plugin ecosystem (such as Intercom's) one step further and become the platform — akin to WeChat. A channel to directly connect to businesses, beyond having a widget within products.

With enough businesses connected, if you can understand intent early enough, you can create direct connections. With a network established, you can connect a customer with an in-depth profile of preferences and needs, allowing for much deeper personalisation than is currently possible.

The relationship doesn't have to stop at digital interactions. It opens up a channel for always-on concierge service. Connecting to a physical helpdesk while in a hotel, directing to the right aisle in a supermarket, identifying preferred physical shops while out in town. The benefit of this approach, in opposition to the Facebook Messenger approach, businesses get to keep their freedom. They don't have to buy into a walled garden like Facebook and Google are trying to create. They exist still as independent online entities through the web and app stores. But by opting in, they have a whole new channel. It offers a defence against the potential of the open web losing out to the walled gardens of the big tech companies. If effectively mediated, this type of personal concierge would open up a whole new opportunity for the strongest possible customer relationships.
