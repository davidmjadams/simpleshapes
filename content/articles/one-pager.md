This is the format we should aim to use for all significant new work. You only need to include the sections where there are relevant details. One-pagers can cover work that could take anywhere between 1 week (tactical) and 3 months (strategic).

Less that 1 week and it's probably too small to need this, more than 3 months and it's probably too long a feedback loop. Just a guideline — YMMV

## Background/Tweet brief

Summarise the work in a sentence or two. What's the background and why is this in consideration. Remember, this is a bet — what are we betting on? Is it high-risk high-reward or a sure thing?

## What is the problem being solved?

Is it business (make more money) or user (achieve a goal)? What is wrong with the current state, what problem are people facing? How can we improve this? What is the ideal outcome?

## Background or customer insight

Any direct feedback from customers relating to this? Requests from departments or clients etc? Have we tried to solve this problem before? What happened?

## What's the hypothesis?

If we solve this problem, what will happen? Will it lead to greater engagement? Better retention? More revenue? What would success look like?

## How can we measure success?

Pick one key metric as a proxy for this outcome, how can we track it and what numbers indicate things have gone well?

## Pivot/proceed/pull gates

We don't want to ship and hope. We don't want to chase a sunk cost. At what points and what metric measurements should we try something different, keep going or pull the feature entirely?

Will we roll out with a subset of users? At what points do we increase user % in that pool? At what point do we do a full roll-out?

## Timeframe

Is this a big bet or a small bet? With big bets, they require a longer time investment 4weeks+, so should have a larger reward. That reward should be worth taking the risk of the time cost. Small bets should be wrapped up quickly, probably with lesser rewards. We don't want to end up giving up too much time to these. If there is significant delay, it's worth asking if we should stop all together.

## Why now/cost of delay

What do we unlock by moving on this now? What would happen if we waited 6 weeks? 3 months? 1 year? What's the risk if we do nothing?

## Confidence of impact

Would you bet a significant amount fo your own money on the success of this? What can we learn early-on to double that bet? Or halve it? Or Reduce it to zero? What % chance of success would you say there is (gut-feel is fine)?

## Size of impact

How big would success be for the company? What's the financial size of the opportunity? What's size of the opportunity in user engagement?

## No-gos/out of scope

Anything explicitly to not be considered as part of this work? Why?

## Leap of faiths

Is there something you feel to be true, but don't have hard evidence to back-up? Why should we take this leap?

## Dependencies/constraints

Is there anything external to this work that impacts it? Is there anything that needs to have happened to be able to start work?
