There has always been something about traditional product roadmaps, especially gannt charts that has made me feel uneasy. I think it’s probably the false sense of control they can give you, if not used carefully. You can plot out some high level features/initiatives over an entire year and suddenly you have a tangible plan, a sense of control over the chaos.

In reality that’s all there is, a _sense of control_, not actual control. We seem to be in an age of scientism, where everyone is jumping on metrics and methodologies, without properly understanding the undelying mechanisms, or why they are important. I was once handed a gannt chart that essentially had a quarter mapped out as workload 1, workload 2, then testing. For a second, it seems like you have a plan. Before you realise it just says do work for an amount of time then finish.

The gannt chart is a common way of visualising a roadmap and progress, it can even be quite effective at this, provided it is used sparingly. To have a vague idea of when you plan to tackle different bodies of work is a solid one. If you are in the business of organising chaos, which you enevitably are if you are in the software business, it is helpful to visualise where you are and where you need to get to.

The main 2 problems these kinds of plans fall into are being too specific, or not specific enough.

## Being too specific

By this, I mean committing too early to concrete features, planning out a whole quarter or year in terms of finite deliverables. You inherently lose any agility you may have had. This anchors your team, investors and customers minds into what you have promised. But plans change, you need to build in scope to alter what you originally planned. Any hard dates for specifics more than a few weeks out are a fools errand. You are unlikely to be spot on first go in your hypothesis of what you need to build. If you aim to be focussed around customer needs, rather than specific features, you open up your routes to meeting that need. You may even find a faster way to get there, or that you don’t need to build anything at all.

## Not being specific enough

Like the workload 1/2 example from above, if you don’t have at least tangential deliverables assocaited with your roadmap, you may as well just colour in a calendar. Something like “build customer dashboard” is too nebulous and intangible. This could be a days work or 6 months work, people will have differing ideas of what is needed and what consitutes done. Equally important here is that it doesn’t state what purpose this feature serves. If however, this was called customer can view and edit order history then you have a desired end goal - without commiting to a specific means of getting there.

## Hill Charts

Recently I saw this tweet from [Jason Fried](https://twitter.com/jasonfried), announcing the launch a new feature in [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/) called [Hill Charts](https://m.signalvnoise.com/new-in-basecamp-see-where-projects-really-stand-with-the-hill-chart/). I already love it.

They are essentially a visualisation tool to give you a super high level view of where progress and understanding of a problem currently are. The idea of two phases of feature development _figuring stuff out_ and _building stuff_ is a powerful one. This tells you at a glance whether you are still in uncharted territory, or working towards the final stretch.

There is a weakness in standard gantt charts, that while they allocate a time period to certain initiatives there seems to be little consensus on how to properly scope each initiative. You don’t have a strong idea of if you are halfway through the period allocated to delivery of a feature, if you are actually half way through a feature. There are proxy measure such as story points burned, features or todos checked off - but these can be misleading and don’t account for enough of the risk that is involved when you are in the _figuring stuff out_ phase.

At first glance the hill chart seems like a great way of giving a human estimate on where things stand, how much uncertainty is reamianing and whteher and major issues have been uncovered.

## Launching a new product

In my job at [Kamet](https://www.kametventures.com/), I'm often focussed on helping startups create and launch brand new products. When I saw the hill chart visualisation, it immediately struck a chord with me. There are loosely 4 four phases we tend to go through: generative research, experimentation, development of the MVP of the product and finally product delivery, feedback and rework. This really neatly maps to the hill metaphor, to describe the level of clarity and direction you have at each stage. The first two, you are trying to clarify, de-risk and understand (heading up the hill), then you can see where you are going from the top, and you are executing in a known field.

## Terrain maps

The imagery of a hill is a powerful one, when you are figuring out how to approach a problem you spend a lot of time in uncertainty without a quantifiable end in sight. But once you inderstand what needs to be done, when hypothesese have been tested you are heading back down the hill into more stable territory.

This led me onto thinking about how you may be able to rethink the gantt chart, to incorporate these 2 phases of developing new features. If each feature has a hill, a roadmap is just a succession of hills. Whether you are building an MVP or augmenting a mature product you ideally want to work through your scariest or most uncertain tasks first - working your way into known territory iteratively. Each one of these is a hill.

You then can line up each hill overlap them slightly so as your team if finishing up with one hill, they are transitioning to discovery of a new hill. This probably works and scales on a team/squad level. So for specific feature sets or products within a catalogue of products.

This way you have a map of the terrain, you know when each feature is nearing certainty and can more accurately guage where you are and whether you are on track with your initial goals. So its a lot like a roadmap, but with an additional dimension. Let’s call it a terrain map.
