As a startup, when you’re just getting started and launching your website, it’s really important to set it up to work for you. To turn visitors into customers.

To do this, it’s important to clearly state what they will be able to achieve with your help. For B2C products, it can be any range of social, productivity or life-quality benefits. With B2B it usually comes down to unlocking revenue potential.

To maximise the conversion of visitors into customers, your site needs to be effective. To give it the best chance of being effective, it needs to:

- Measure the total number of visitors and their behaviour
- Convert as many of these visitors as possible into qualified leads
- Optimise this conversion, by allowing experimentation with changes to layout/content
- Gather insight and feedback on what customers are looking to get out of the product

## Measure the total number of visitors and their behaviour

Measuring visitors is an easy first step, there are a whole host of analytics tools available. For marketing websites, [Google Analytics](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/) is a market leader, has everything you need to get started quickly and importantly for a startup – is free. There are a number of other good options for analytics such as [MixPanel](https://mixpanel.com/), [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/) and [Heap](https://heap.io/). However, these products really come into their own when used with apps/web apps, when your interaction events are much more customised to your specific product. For a website where page views and signup funnels are your main concern, [GA](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/) should have all you need.

## Convert as many of these visitors as possible into qualified leads

You have a few options when it comes to capturing qualified leads. It’s important to have an obvious place for potential customers to sign-up, request a callback or make their interest known to you.

The first port of call is probably email capture, [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/) provides drop-in tools for users to enter their email address, which then is added directly to a MailChimp mailing list – which you can use to follow up, and if opted-in, send out marketing email campaigns to inform and convince them of your service’s value.

Beyond that, conversational marketing platforms such as [Drift](http://drift.com) and [Intercom](https://intercom.com) provide advanced tools for automatically qualifying leads, live chat and increasing activation. They can significantly improve engagement by putting easy to use tools in the hands of your visitors, to ask any questions they may have, giving you a direct line to further convince them. They also give you the option to trigger tailored messages based on certain behaviours. For example, asking if there is something that is unclear to them when you notice they have returned to your site for a second visit.

## Optimise this conversion, by allowing experimentation with changes to layout/content

To test the current performance of your site's conversion, you need to set up a conversion funnel. This is a series of steps a user needs to go through to either sign-up or show intent to get more information. These are usually click through steps they need to make. It might be something like: open a certain page, click to book a demo, select a date for the booking and confirm. You can then measure the steps where users are dropping off and work to increase the performance of each step. It’s important to try to filter out the real potential customers from the time wasters. By asking for some form of a commitment, whether it is a payment, booking a demo or at least submission of more details such as their phone number. This will help you reduce the time spent on users that are never going to pay for your service.

A/B testing can be a really powerful tool for optimising your website’s messaging and interaction flows. By serving different versions to different segments of your audience, you can measure which version converts better. [Optimizely](optimizely.com), [Google Optimize](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/optimize/) and [VWO](vwo.com) are some of the leading tools to choose from. Google’s tool again is excellent and free, so is likely the best place to get started. On the other end of the scale, Optimizely is usually prohibitively expensive for a new startup (\$1000s per month).

The major caveat to this is that for A/B testing to be effective, you need to have a reasonable amount of traffic – most experiments will require at least a few thousand to show statistical significance.

Obviously, as a newly launched startup, you might not be there quite yet. If you have relatively low visitor numbers, major design changes, rather than tweaking around the edges are more likely to show significant changes in user behaviour. You can use a [sample size calculator](https://www.evanmiller.org/ab-testing/sample-size.html) to work out how large a sample you will need.

In the very first period around launch, it is generally more effective to opt for usability testing instead. You will get deeper, qualitative insight into how your users are receiving your product and message. [UserTesting](usertesting.com) and [Lookback](https://lookback.io/) both offer great solutions for getting fast insights. UserTesting can handle the participant recruitment for you, Lookback requires you to provide your own participants. You can also use services such as [Respondent](respondent.io) to source them for you.

## Gather insight and feedback on what customers are looking to get out of the product

At the moment a potential customer engages with your product, such as requesting a callback or sending an intercom message, there is a golden opportunity to find out why they came to your site and what they are seeking to achieve. By asking a few key questions at the time of capture, you can start to build up a picture of what your users are looking for and why they came to you for it. This can be as simple as integrating a [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/) or [Google Forms](https://www.google.co.uk/forms/about/) survey into your email capture flow or asking some targeted questions in your Intercom/Drift engagement.

## Conclusion

There are almost unlimited tools and techniques available to optimize your website, the choice can be overwhelming. But as long as you are putting some effort into measuring visitors, qualifying leads, optimizing conversion, and gathering feedback you are on the right track. Pick one or two things to focus on at a time, otherwise, it will be hard to tell which changes are working.
