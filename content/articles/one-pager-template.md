# One-pagers

I've been from the school of "what problem are we actually trying to solve" product management for some time now. But for a long while, this was more in the conversations we were having, rather than anything too stragetic. We'd have the questions and debate, then everything would go into JIRA (sorry) as a story and lose the fidelity and nuance behind the discussion.

For the few months, I've taken the plunge into using proper one-pagers. [one-pager description]. We use these to assess priorities

It draws on the work of some great minds, ryan singer (shapeup), john cutler, here are some great resources [cutler etc, share links]

When I started looking into it, I struggled to find many examples of one-pagers people were using in the wild. So I thought it might help someone, somewhere if I shared mine.

We've been using variations of this format with success for a while. If some of the sections/wording seem like they have been lifted, almost verbatim from the works mentioned above, trust your instincts.

Below is the template that our one-pagers start from, with explanations of what is expected in each section.

Hope this is useful for someone :)
