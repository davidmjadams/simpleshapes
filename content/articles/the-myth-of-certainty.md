- I can’t give you certainty. Experts talk in terms of maybe probably etc, Stephen fry video - myth of certainty

- Turns out all best practices, frameworks etc are made up. They start with good intentions, but get implemented word for word, without understanding of why. You can tell ask why they will say “best practice”

When you grow up you, tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world, try not to bash into the walls too much, try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money. That’s a very limited life. Life can be much broader, once you discover one simple fact, and that is that everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you’ll never be the same again.”
